# Sample-Pumpkin-Series-Walkthrough
This are three VulnHub machines from the same series
Pumpkin Garden
Pumpkin Raising
Pumpkin Festival
i have created a simple walkthrough of how i managed to work on them.
The main goal in this series was to capture the flags and get the root access of the vulnerable machine.
I used CherryTree a note taking application in kali linux.
